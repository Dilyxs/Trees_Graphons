# Trees_Graphons
SHOUTOUT TO ANTOINE POULIN, big man who basically told me what to do: https://antoinegpoulin.github.io/
IMPORTANT STUFF:

distribution_mass_composite -> Jupyter notebook where we observe in a composite tree(one side with uniform attachment model, the other with straight line), as you distribute weigth 
 across the tree, how does the distribution of the mass change? 

iteration_required_stab -> Jupyter notebook where we observe the iterations required per node_size in a UAM model. -> Seems stable as n-> inf

heat_m_vertex_edge -> Jupyter notebook where we observe the likelyhood of a tree having a edge or a vertex as its barycenter as n->small number to n->large numbers

delta_entropy_3Trees -> Jupyter notebook where we observe the change in entropy as delta(diffusion factor) is changed across 3 different tree models -> UAM, SL & Galt-Wat
Also contains clean graph of SL as n-> with entropy as delta varies


gif_creator -> Jupyter notebook where we write code for creation of gif showing variation in prob mass density as we change diffusion. Results projected in gifs folder

/graphon/IMPORTANT_ONE -> Displays critical graphon especially fao_trade -> USV ALGO. Pros:Realiable, fast isn't changed by manipulation
Cons:Performs poorly on scarce graphons




Rest of the python files & csv files: Saved data used to recollect. Do not mind it too much.
test_files_nothing_to_display -> Folder where I tested and ran code for functions.
